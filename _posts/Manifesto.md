-try new things
-be customisable and adaptable
-keep an open mind
-work to the best of our skills but ask for help when we need it
-prototype and keep moving forward
-be organised and on task by having a timekeeper and notetaker.


together as a group we will work to achieve these things in order to build a successful project :)
