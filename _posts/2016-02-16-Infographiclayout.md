This is the Infographic Layout that I have made and we are planning to have step by step instructions in the blank squares.

I have used earth colour for the first layout that I have made but I have realized that the final model in 3D blends in too much into the background so Kate and I decided to use cool colour (like light blue and charcoal)

We have used charcoal, light grey, blue for the layout. Now the model doesn't blend into the background and it is much more crisp. Also the colour blue/black represents darkness so I thought It would be suitable for the layout colour (so I could emphasize the colour of the lamp).
