title: What we are up to

We’re interested in creating a customizable and sustainable motion sensor light. That also looks really nice.

For our main material we’re using a 3mm bamboo ply.

To make our lights unique to us, we’ve used inspiration from nz motifs to create our own kerf patterns. Koru, north island volcanic plateau and also the fantail.

Keeping sustainable we’re wanting to create a light that uses minimal materials and no permanent fixings like glue. So we’ve developed the slot base and connection pieces that the body sits in:

AND now we’re working on a solution for fixing the body to itself in cylinder, an easy way to address this may be using a hemp twine to weave and sew between the kerf gaps.

This week we’re looking at getting stuck into the electronics and figuring out how the sensor and led’s can work together, on that note the sensors will be located on the lid and the led’s will drop down from the lid inside down to the base.
