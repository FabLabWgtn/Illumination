Here is the infographic that I have fixed and added. What we need is final photo of the model and how to work 2 sensors but if only one sensor goes I am going to fill the gap with the final electronic photo.
Obviously this is only the screenshot of infographic so it will be pixelated when you try to zoom in zoom out. The actual file is going to go on to our master branch but this shows you the basic layout and components of the infographic
