Today Fin and Kate successfully programmed our Fabduino using macbook.

Kate made a ring and fixed the joints on illustrator in order to print out on our laser cutter so the ring could stay and fix the shape of our lamp. Now our lamp is in perfect cylinder shape.

We have also purchased sensors from Jaycar 

Our next step is to connect LED light and sensors onto our Fabduino.
