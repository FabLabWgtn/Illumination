When laser cutting our cardboard was a bit lifted up from the bed so few of them has a charcoal mark and the pattern didn't quite make a fine cut but we managed to pull out the parts by using our nails.

Our prototype

How the shades would look like. Obviously we haven't quite laser cut 3 lamps to stack it up together but when it does we are not going to have a cross like it is showing upon the ceiling instead it will be covered with the lid with the sensor on it. 


Kate had a go at making arduino but Creig is figuring out the rest of the process so we cannot do anything for it until Creig figures out how to. 

For our model we are still figuring out how to join the edges for the body (so it makes full cylinder without tapping or holding).
