At the moment because of how the joint is made up into cross shapes we can't extend the bulb onto the second & third cylinder. 
For our first solution we thought that if we leave a gap in the middle of the joint we could actually get LED tube to sit in the middle but we did not wanted to use glue too much or either make it complicated because while they install the lamp they might snap the joint if there are too much processes involved.

so thinking about that issue we wanted flexible LED strip or LED tube which would bend easily and hang inside our lamp.

but if we make this led strips or led tube hang inside the lamp it might look ugly when you look at it from outside without the light on (in day time) so I did some research on how to decorate around the led strip.

Obviously I didn't want bulky decoration or non sustainable materials such as plastic tube to cover Led light I wanted to use bamboo if possible

so basically if we laser cut multiples of bamboo ring with a rigged edges(inverted) we will be able to infix bamboo ring around LED strip and people could customize this light by simply pulling it upward or downward in their preference. This way if we even the bamboo rings around LED strip people wouldn't be able to see ugly LED strip through our pattern holes but just see multiples of bamboo in a pipe shape.
