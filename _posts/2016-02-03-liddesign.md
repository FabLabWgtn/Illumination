Our model is cyliner shaped but I wanted to see how it would look like if it was in other shape such as triangle, square.
The best shape to use is cylinder because we want our model to be eco-friendly and glue free.
We will try to create a living hinge so the materials could bend well and not snap off.

Because Our outer designs are sorted I though I would have a look at design suttle element such as designing a lid. I thought I would use patterns that Kate have made to create a logo.

Here are the final design of the lid.
