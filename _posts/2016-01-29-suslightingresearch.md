“Sustainable Lighting is lighting designed with energy efficient light sources. The most sustainable source of lighting is daylight, other forms are solar lamps harvesting daylight and lighting controlled by occupation sensors. Furthermore technologies such as light-emitting diodes can be used to drastically reduce the energy requirement for energy.” [sustainablelighting wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_lighting "wiki")

“Sustainable lighting design is more than achieving a watts per metre square target.  It should consider the entire lighting system - from the materials used to the location of the manufacturers and the ongoing maintenance.” [The forgotten elements of sustainable lighting design, Article courtesy of Lighting magazine, Vol 32, issue 4, August/September 2012]

“Fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, natural gas, and their byproducts—supply approximately 80 percent of the world’s primary energy needs today. Use of these fuels drives industrialized economies and has become integral to virtually every aspect of productive activity and daily life throughout the modern world.” [Lighting the Way: Toward a Sustainable Energy Future, InterAcademies Council, 1 October 2007]

“Traditional incandescent and halogen downlights are dramatically inefficient. 95% of the power they use gets converted to heat, not light.”
