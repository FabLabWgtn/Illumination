Once the Atmega as been programmed, you can hook up all the sensors and in the places you need them. Make sure all the wires are long enough and not getting in the way of other components.

The pins on the side might need to be reinforced with hot glue, because they will break if you are taking connections on and off all the time

If you keep getting errors, make sure all the connections are in the right place and the code is correct.

If you click the 'serial monitor' button in the top right corner of Arduino, it will show a new window with numbers down one side. This intercates whether the sensors are being read through the fabuino. The highter you rase your hand, the higher the numbers read etc.
