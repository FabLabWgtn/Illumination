After designing a logo from our Nz motif pattern we have decided not to use our patterns for our logo but instead we wanted to describe our lamp's characteristic using our logo. 
I have started off as making a simple logo from the letter 'M' (standing for mahi=making)
and then because this logos on top looked like a clothing company label I have developed more.

The last logo that I have created represents 'simple' but 'fun' aspect of our lamp.
