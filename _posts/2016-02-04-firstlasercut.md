As a team we did laser cutting session with Creig

and then we had a go at lasercutting together. We have used bamboo as our material and realized there are no such setting for to cut bamboo.
We have used 4mm poplar setting and reduced down the power of Red and Blue, while cutting it with laser we noticed that it would have been faster if we increased the speed instead of decresing the setting.

How it might actually look like if it was bended into cylinder shape.
Our prototype hasn't got any charcoal marks but it has a bit of tan around the shape. We could easily fix this by increasing the speed.
