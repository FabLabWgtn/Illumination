Things to do this week
Figuring out the dimension of the cylinder (for stable model). 
Trying to overlap both ends so we dont have to sew.
figuring out Arduino (programming).
Test prototype with bamboo (see if it behaves well and bend as we want to). 
If it doesn`t change material to cardboard or work more on kerf bend so bamboo can bend more.
