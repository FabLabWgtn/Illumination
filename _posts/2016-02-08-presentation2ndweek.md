Things to do this week
Figuring out the dimension of the cylinder (for stable model) 
trying to overlap both ends so we don`t have to sew
figuring out Arduino
Test prototype with bamboo (see if it behaves well and bend as we want to) 
If it doesn`t change material to cardboard or work more on kerf bend so bamboo can bend more.
