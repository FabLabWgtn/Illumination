using the golden ratio, 1.6, to inform what size cylinder we will make. 

![golden ratio]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ratios.jpg)

We've decided to go with 25cm High including lid height. which means our base circumfrence is 49.06cm

hight/ratio = diamiter * pie = circumfrence
25/1.6 = 15.625 * 3.14 = 49.06
