Thinking about the inner light design, the sketches that I have made can make our process complicated and fiddly. Therefore we thought if we stick Led strip light on the edge of the model we will get a nice shading and also we weren't be able to see much of the ugly LED strip. Which actually makes sense because hallway light doesn't normally stay in middle of the hallway but people push it onto the edge so the light doesn't get in the way when walking past.

Here is the lid that we have made. The middle part is hollow therefore we can have our sensors, fabduino sitting on the middle of the lid.

As a group we are thinking about how to call this lamp. Our patterns contains part of New Zealand's nature therefore we want the name to be meaningful as well which could portray the beauty of New Zealand Aotearoa.
