Kate had figured out the diameter of the circle and made a actual sized prototype in illustrator.

Now we know that our pattern bends so we are making a prototype in actual size with the cardboard.

Instead of making a full sized cyliner lamp we made half opened lamp by mistake. 
We need at least half longer sized body and next time when we are laser cutting we have to increase the power in order to get a nice cut. At the moment the shape is all engraved but it hasn't cut through properly!.
