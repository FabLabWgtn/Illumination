I started by analyzing the meaning of our pattern. I have got harmony& new beginning as a key word in our patterns. After that I have looked into maori words that related to our lamp such as sustainable (related to untouched,pure nature), shine, light and then words related to makers movement such as design, making, meaning..

and then I have connected various of words to make our lamp name. I've tried to make it fluent as possible. 'mahi mo mahi' 'making for making' relates to the aspect of makers movement and is the most refined name that I could come up with. Mahi actually means various things such as practise, make, accomplish, perform, do, to work.
(If it is too long I could pull mo out and call it mahimahi which could mean 'makingmaking', 'doingmaking' 'makingworking')
