Here is our timetable for the final week: scheduled by Kate
We are still figuring out how long our programming will take but we have planned everything to finish on Wednesday so that if anything happens and doesn't work we still have chance to make our final model achieveable before Friday. 

Team member Roles:
As a team industrial designer, builder Fin took part in souldering& programming fabduino, researching& collecting materials, made initial sketches and
making realistic ideas in order to make our model to work. Fin was interested in hands on duty and made many prototypes for to refine. 

As a team Spacial designer,timekeeper, illustrator Kate took part in designing NZ motif patterns, creating lasercut files to make prototypes, CAD,blogger(documentation), prototype maker. Kate always tried to think in realistic ways in order to achieve sustainable and refined outcomes. 

As a team visual communicator,Note taker,creative idea maker Minjoo took part in team Documentation she made refined sketches,photographed the process and was mostly interested in blogging. Minjoo was a team contactperson who made sure everything was up to date and filled in the gap if it wasn't. 

Like our team manifesto we always challenged ourselves to keep moving forward. When we were stuck we have done more researches and sketches in order to make a better result. As a team we are trying to work out how to make our model sustainable as possible but because it is an opensourced we wanted our model to be simple as well. Not because we don't want to try, it is because we know following complicated model is hard for people who hasn't done DIY before and to avoid people getting scared about designing.
As designers we wanted to create sustainable, affordable, elegant light which many people could follow, have fun in making process and finally recreating what we have made into something else creative. I believe that is the whole point of the maker movement.
‘The maker movement is not about the ‘stuff’ we can make, it’s about the ‘meaning’ we can make.’ (quote by. Jay Silver)
