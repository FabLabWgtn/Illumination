title: Thinking about the shape of the model
---

Why did we choose to use cylinder for shape of the model?: Basically we want  sustainable light which would stand in people's hallway. When it is dark we can't really see the environment and there is a risk for people to bump into the objects.
We thought about using a sphere to make our light rounder but in order to top up lights we cannot use shape sphere for our model. Cube is a stable shape with the flat base and we could easily top up other cube onto the base cube but it isn't a friendly shape to bump into. We have avoided shapes which has many edges for safety reasons and also we wanted shape which wouldn't use too much material such as hexagon for sustainable reason. In conclusion we thought cylinder would be the best option to make the hallway light.
