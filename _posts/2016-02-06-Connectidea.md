title: Wood Joinery (no glue) 
---

Last class we were figuring out how to join each end of the model together. We have temporarily put the tape around the edge but we wanted to make sure that we use no glue and no tape if it is possible.

Here I have sketched some ways to connect each end.

Here are some examples that uses the wood joinery idea.

Our model is made out of bamboo and also it is very fine and thin therefore making a big hole or hinges might break our model so Kate came up with the idea of sewing/ stitching.

By using this sewing/ knitting idea we weren't break our model and also people could customize their own lamp by having their own special Embroidery with certain animals/things that they like.
