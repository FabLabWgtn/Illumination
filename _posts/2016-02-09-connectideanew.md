We were thinking of overlapping both ends together to fixetate but we thought it might be hard if we were to put another 2 cylinders on top of other cylinder. 

Therefore we made a conclusion that if we have a hole on both ends and pin it together it will make a perfect cylinder. Fin went to get a pin from bunnings in tory street.
