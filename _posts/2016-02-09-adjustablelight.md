Thinking about the golden ratio we were also thinking about how to make our models in adjustable ways.
One of them stretch in landscape and changes their size wide
and one of them stretches in horizontal and changes their height. 
our aim is to minimalize materials for the sustainable purpose therefore we might keep it the way it is and just change our model into golden ratio for the balance.

This doesn't necessarily mean that we will stop our process and play in the safe zone but when we figure out the size of our cylinder we want to try something new such as making the model adjustable or more customizable.
