title: Laser cutting failure
---

Today we wanted to see if our models would stand nicely as we have expected therefore we were planning to cut out three cylinder models to top it up together.

Here is the original illustration file from Kate

and here are the blanc file that I have made to reduce down the laser cutting time.

The laser cutting of the corrugated cardboard was ok there were no charcoal marks and the cuts were clean.

We didn't have other cardboard to use so we used corrugated cardboard

but the problem was that this material folded badly and made edges instead of bending nicely into cylinder shape

We are cutting a poly on the lasercutter but we had many issues on this material as well because when laser cut out the shape it stuck together right away.
We have increased the power on the setting manualy and it is giving us a cut but I don't think it will be clean as we have cut cardboards. We are planning to cut our bamboo sheet when all the sized are right because we know that the Kerfpattern is working on our material. 


Settings changed for cutting poly 0.65mm 
power=45%
speed=12%
