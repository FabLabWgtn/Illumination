title: Wednesday class poly prototype

![prototype]({{site.baseurl}}/images/polyprototype.jpg)
so this is what I have made out of Poly. It bends really well therefore I had no problem connecting both edges together

![prototype]({{site.baseurl}}/images/polyprototype1.jpg)
![prototype]({{site.baseurl}}/images/polyprototype2.jpg)
Even so I couldn't test the joint parts well (because it was too weak to hold cylinders together)


The next process that I am planning to do is laser cutting the actual bamboo sheet to see if it bends well. 
Fin was having a problem with the fabduino program so there is no process on arduino yet but he will post later on about his process.
