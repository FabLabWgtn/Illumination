I had a go at making a pattern but Kate said birds might look a bit to cute on our lamp
so maybe if I sketch up some simplified pattern designs and make a new pattern out of it it might work..??
I don't know if this shape will bend
pattern was motivated by New Zealand native birds and Maori Symbol Koru
