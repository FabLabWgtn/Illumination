We want sensors which will detect our movement from 4cm~3m far therefore we have found this sensor URM37 V3.2 Ultrasonic sensor.

It is currently out of stock at the moment so we would have to find similar sensor around Wellington but this kind of sensors are what we want to get.

This would be about 3m far, our group figured out the measurement by the measuring tape.

We are planning to get it before this week so we could have a go at making a lid in the weekend or earlier next week.
