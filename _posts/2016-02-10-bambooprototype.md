title: bamboo prototype
---

In previous processes we have looked into: 
Nz Motif Pattern designs, How the pattern bends and creates shadows
the joints that holds cylinders together, 
the way to hold both edges together,
Golden ratio to make our model stable (size of the model), 
setting up for laser cutting bamboo (there were no setting for bamboo)

Finally this is the first attempt to cut bamboo sheet in real lamp size. 
All the settings are right so everything has cut through well.

Here is our prototype, our joints are working well and connecting edges with pins are fine as well

the only problem I think is that if you see the shape of cylinder it isn't actually round as we want it to be. The resolution for this is to not cut the pattern until the edge so that it doesn't change the roundness of the cylinder. (changing the layout of the pattern might solve this problem)

Though our pattern bends quite well regarding that it is a wood.


Fin was having a problem with the fabduino program so there is no process on arduino yet but he will post later on about his process.

Our next process will be looking into the lid that would sit on top of the cylinder.
The lid will have 2 sensors, fabduino, LED light attached to it and we are thinking of making a slot for those to perfectly fit in the lid (so nothing hangs out of the lamp).
