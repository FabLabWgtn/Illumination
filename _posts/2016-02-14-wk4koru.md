getting ready to laser cut our first final tomorrow! 

we're doubling up on the base and body brackets to make the whole structure more stable, we will sandwhich and timber glue these togther.

have also cut down the amount of 'buttons' that run along the seam of the lamp - we now have just three.

only cutting one interior ring tomorrow as we already have another from a previous prototype that we can use.
